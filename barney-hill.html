             <p>Barney and Betty Hill were an American couple who claimed they were abducted by extraterrestrials in a rural portion of the state of New Hampshire from September 19 to 20, 1961. they recalled a brightly lit craft that followed them and somehow cut off the engine to there car, they awoke sometime later with no recollection of the missing time but more perculiarly, they had switched seats during this period. It was the first widely publicized report of an alien abduction in the United States</p>

                <p>Betty Hill famously drew a star map from memory, in 1964, whilst under psychoanalysis. The map was later confirmed to have been an accurate representation of the star system <i>zeta reticuli</i>. betty claimed to have been shown a map to the star from which the alien abductors had arrived.</p>

                    <p>A series of disturbing dreams and other problems led the Hills to seek psychiatric help. Between January and June 1964, under hypnosis, they recounted the landing of the UFO, the emergence of its occupants, their abduction into the craft, and separately experienced medical examinations. </p>
